# Student Marks Prediction with Machine Learning

# About Dataset

<b> Description : </b>

The data consists of Marks of students including their study time & number of courses. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Properties of the Dataset:

Number of Instances: 100

Number of Attributes: 3 including the target variable.

The project is simple yet challenging as it is has very limited features & samples. Can you build regression model to capture all the patterns in the dataset, also maitaining the generalisability of the model?

<b> Objective : </b>

* Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).

* Build Regression models to predict the student marks wrt multiple features.

* Also evaluate the models & compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

***

This project aims to Predict students mark based on their hourly study per day and also predict the minimum hours need to do to pass the exam.

Python Packages : Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
